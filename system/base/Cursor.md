# Cursor Specific Instructions

## Planning

Create a clear plan by listing out the tasks you need to complete. You can use comments in your code or a separate notes file to track progress.

## Code Review

To run code reviews, invoke the `@agent-senior-code-reviewer` rule after completing each coding subtask. Type:

```
@agent-senior-code-reviewer
```

Then describe what changes you made for the review.

The rule will guide the AI to analyze the code for:
- Code quality and best practices
- Potential bugs or issues
- Performance considerations
- Security vulnerabilities
