# Codex Specific Instructions

## Planning

Create a clear plan by listing out the tasks you need to complete. Track your progress in `.agents/todos.md` or use comments in your code.

## Code Review

To run code reviews, invoke the `senior-code-reviewer` skill after completing each coding subtask. The skill will be automatically activated when you ask for a code review.

The skill will analyze the code for:
- Code quality and best practices
- Potential bugs or issues
- Performance considerations
- Security vulnerabilities
